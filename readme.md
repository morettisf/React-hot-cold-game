## Background
This hot/cold game was built as part of a React/Redux assignment at Thinkful. The object of the game is to guess the correct number between 1 - 100 while getting feedback throughout based on how close you are. The app keeps track of state through Redux and fetches/posts the fewest guess count through an API created with Node/Express.
