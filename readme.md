## Background
This hot/cold guessing game was built on React and Redux frameworks. The object of the game is to guess the correct number between 1 - 100 while getting feedback throughout based on how close you are. The app keeps track of state through Redux and fetches/posts the fewest guess count through an API created with Node/Express.
